`Worth Eat` is the inaugural mobile app developed by ISCARAPPS S.L., committed to combatting domestic food waste. This app is designed for both IOS and Android platforms and is accompanied by a dedicated website.

## Description
`Worth Eat` is designed with a primary focus to minimize food wastage. Users can effortlessly record the expiration dates of their grocery items simply by capturing a photo of the expiration date. This information is stored in the app's proprietary database. As the food nears its expiry date, `Worth Eat` alerts the user through a notification. This app also suggests potential recipes that can be prepared with the food close to expiry.

Moreover, `Worth Eat` supports the donation of products to food banks and also offers the facility to buy and sell food close to expiry at a reduced price.

## Motivation
The European Union sees an alarming quantity of food wastage each year, with each citizen throwing away an estimated 180 kg of food per year. Out of this, 39% is discarded because it has expired.

More specifically, Spain, ranks seventh in the European Union for wasting food, discarding 7.7 million tons per year. A detailed breakdown of the statistics reveals the following distribution of food waste: households - 42%, production process - 39%, distribution - 5%, and restoration - 14%.

In 2018, Spanish households were responsible for wasting around 1.12 million tons of consumable food. `Worth Eat` aims to change this narrative by providing practical solutions to tackle food waste at the household level.
